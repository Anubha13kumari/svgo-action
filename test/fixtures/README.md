# Fixtures

## `*.svg`

The `.svg` files in this directory are there to be optimized by the integration
tests. They should remain in an not-optimized state.

## `svg-files.json`

The `svg-files.json` file contains both optimized and not-optimized SVGs as
strings.

## `svgo-vX-options.json`

The `svg-v1-options.json` and `svg-v2-options.json` files are simple JSON files
with valid configurations for SVGO v1.x.x and v2.x.x. respectively.
